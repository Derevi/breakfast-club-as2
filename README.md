## Guidelines

## Using the Issue Tracker
- This will be the tracker for the next project. All members content must be posted to github, if it is not here it is assumed that it doesnt exist.
- Post either in to your respective issues (file or link), or push to the main repo in your own dir or file (just make a reference to it so its easy to see on you issue).
- Members assigned heavy workloads especially more technical ones, are encouraged to communicate with other who do not have as heavy a burden, and assign them some work via issues. Additionally members who are aware that their part is light should notify others that they are open for tasks. This will require you to keep tabs on what others are doing but the goal is to have everyone contribute as close to equal as possible.
- each issue will have its on thread and refer to some unit of work, which will be used to post revisions (by the assigned person) and also be used for all other members to comment and review. 
- All members should review, and comment on all other members via the issue thread.


## Meetings
- any issue labelled as "meeting" is deemed mandatory by the team, you must attend, a few days notice will be given. 
- All mandatory meetings must have todos, and will have notes associated so that they are productive. 
- After a meeting is completed, that associated issue will be updated, with everything we talked about then closed.
- all members are encouraged to add agenda items for these meetings, just reply to the thread.
- Mandatory meetings will also track who was present.
